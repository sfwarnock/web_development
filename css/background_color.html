    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been sraring out the window for about and hour now. On
      her desk, lying between the copies of <i> Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
      the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>
      On The Road</cite>.  It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she
      spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Ocsar Wilde
      quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refugee of the people who have nothing better to do.</q>
      Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama
      <abbr title ="Deoxyriboncleic acid"> DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achivement,
      Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
